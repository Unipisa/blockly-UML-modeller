# modeLLer

ModeLLer is a prototype of a web tool accessible to end-users for modelling systems. 

The tool's current version enables users with no expertise in formal notations to generate UML class diagrams by interacting with a block-based visual editor. The interface is divided into three main areas: a toolbox panel for the exploration and selection of blocks; a workspace where blocks can be added to and interlocked with other blocks to form the structure of the system; and an export area with export data and buttons.

Models are created following a guided procedure prompted on the blocks.

All the items dropped on the workspace are simultaneously translated into UML entities using the XMI format. The XMI export code can be  imported into any UML design software supporting XMI to obtain a UML class diagram.
